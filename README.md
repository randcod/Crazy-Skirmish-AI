# Skirmish Pro
New AI Mod for Warhammer 40 000: Dawn of War - Soulstorm based on Dawn Of Skirmish SS.

Please note, the main goal of this AI is to improve its game level, so that AI can be a worthy opponent to strong players. 
Functions like dancing, harrasing etc will be enabled by default and you cannot disable them!
This AI made for work only with "Insane" level of complexity. The remaining levels have not been tested and their work is not guaranteed!
