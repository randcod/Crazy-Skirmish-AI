2.) Attack Delay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This forces the AI to wait with an attack until a specif time has passed.
You can adjust this time in two minute steps from 0 to 20 minutes.

3.) Tech Speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With an increased teching speed, the AI will spend its resources more on teching than on building troops.
With a decreased teching speed, the AI will spend its resources more on building troops than on teching.

4.) Teching Handicap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A handicap will slow down the teching of an AI. It will also hoard more ressources
instead of spending it immediately for units or buildings.
You can give allies an handicap or opponents. If you give allies a handicap, all
AI's allied with a human player are affected. If you give opponents a handicap, all
AI's not allied with a human player are affected. You can use this behaviour for
example to weaken AI opponents if you don't feel good enough to face them at full
strength. Or you want the exact opposite, a real challenge, and weaken your own
allies, so you have to do more yourselve.

5.) Allow alternative strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All AI's have 4 different strategies:

- A solid allround strategy
- A special ranged strategy
- A special melee strategy
- A vehicle fast tech strategy

If alternative strategies are activated, the AIs will choose one of those strategies at the start by
random, though the chances of each strategy are influenced by opponent and map size. If deactivated,
the AI will always choose the solid allround strategy.

6.) Early Harassing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This allows commanders and combat troops to make an attack at an extremly early state to
avoid opposing scout capturing strategic points. If successfull, this can severly cripple
the opponents ressource income and decide the game at a very early state. On the other side,
harassing can also lead to a quick sacrifice of troops, which gives the opponent an advantage.
Harassing is only possible in the first 4 minutes.

7.) Dynamic Production Buildings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The AI normally builds more troop production buildings if it has excess ressources. This allows
often an outproducing of the opponenr who can't replace its losses fast enough.
Bear in mind that the AI might still build more troop production because of other reasons. IG for
example need to build them to increase their squad and support caps. In this case those buildings
are normally only built a bit later. This can also hurt the balance between the races since some
of them are affected more and others less of it.

8.) Build Relic units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If deactivated, the AI won't build any Relic units like the Baneblade from the Imperial Guard or the Chaos
Bloodthirster.

9.) Build turrets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If deactivated, the AI won't build any turrets (except Orc Waagh Banners).

10.) Build mines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If deactivated, the AI won't build any mines.

(Short Term)

o Ensure Commander Unit is kept away OR minimizes his exposure to combat under Assassinate victory conditions
o AI Squads should pursue enemies who are near defeat and deliever the final deathblow rather than halt the advance
o AI Squads should better attack in large numbers rather than sacrifice single weak squads instead

(Long Term)

o Build 2-3 turrets around Large Generators
o Creates a secondary HQ + unit production buildings w/ defensive turrets (randomly upgraded) all built away from the enemy
o Inter AI communications between alliance games (better AI team coordination when defending fellow allies and assaulting enemy bases/LPs)


Maybes (If Possible):
~~~~~~
o Squad-level awareness and effective use of Cover
o Allow 1-2 Engineers to repair damaged idle vehicles at/near the battlefront (possible issue if vehicle group is called back to battle)
o Before an AI Ally is conquered, he will tribute all his req/power to fellow players
o Transporting infantry into combat using transports
o Determine how to get the AI to use such things as Infiltrate and the Squiggoth's Rampage (both non-standard abilities)
o Determine why AIs allied on a human team build up and attack more slowly than on a exclusively AI team

Omitted:
~~~~~~~
o Adding vehicles that were removed for the AI to use (ie. Space Marines/Chaos Rhino) - Such vehicles aren't "yet" worth their battlefield reputation


Known Issues
============
o Maps with limited Startpoint build space (ie. 4p_Biffys Peril) *may* still cause the AI to clutter buildings together thus disallowing some vehicles and even uber-units through. This will be rectified in subsequent releases.

o Maps with limited check/strategy points where income gathering is somewhat low (ie. 8p_Penal Colony), the AI tends to struggle a little more than usual. Until we can determine a means to dynamically-change the AI's resource plans, it will flounder a little more than normal compared to maps with prolific resource points.
